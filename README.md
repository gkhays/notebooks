# notebooks
A collection of Jupyter notebooks.

## binder
Clicking the `launch binder` badge, above, will allow you to interact with the notebooks. Of course it is always an option to click on the notebook and GitHub will statically render it. Here is what the binder looks like.

## Docker

It is a big productivity gain to host notebooks in a Docker container. To use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file start (or compose) a container with
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Then you will need to take a quick look in the logs for the `URL` including the token.
```bash
Î» docker logs datascience
/usr/local/bin/start-notebook.sh: ignoring /usr/local/bin/start-notebook.d/*

Container must be run with group "root" to update passwd file

I used the [datascience-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/) from the [Jupyter Docker Science Stack](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Note: This image presents a `work` folder as a top-level directory, so navigating into it will take you to the available notebooks. E.g.
